When I first took a a look at chartbeat.com, I was slightly confused as to why the website was set up the way it is.
After reading that they offer real-time tools for websites, it began to make more sense. I liked how as you scroll
down the site, the information is presented in a slideshow-like manner, complete with updated live information about
various aspects of the website. There are also buttons that take the user to the next "page" of info.

The information on the website is presented in a logical way as the user scrolls down the page. The general color
scheme and design is pleasing to the eye. The contact information is located at the bottom of the page and is
well-organized. Overall, the website is successful in delivering its content in an effective way.
