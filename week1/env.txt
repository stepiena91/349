After having used Dreamweaver in a few past classes, I'm fairly positive that I would rather use Textmate. While it is nice to be able to use Dreamweaver's split view to see what your code is doing, it doesn't always show what it will actually look like, which can be annoying. Also, I think it will be easier to follow along with your instructions if we're using the same program.
