	<h1>Critique</h1>
	<p>While at first I was wary of panic.com's home page setup, after a closer look I realized it's very effective in communicating what panic does and what products they offer. The interface isn't distracting to the user, but still stands out. Each product page is very informative and communicates to customers everything they need to know.</p>
	<p>At the bottom of the page, there is a help section that allows users to contact panic through twitter or various other methods. Overall, panic.com is a well-designed site that manages a good balance of utility and aesthetics.
