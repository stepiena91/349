I would say my first critique of this website is the "dual side" format for listing the articles in the "home" and "articles" sections. I don't think it's a very intuitive way to find what you're looking for, but I suppose that's why there are filters and a search bar function on the site. Also, the information and links at the bottom of the page are oddly-placed and slightly confusing at first glance.

As far as positive elements of the site, I would say that the navigation and filters are very helpful. I think that having pictures/videos next to the new articles on the home page is both appealing to the eye and convenient for users. Lastly, the overall look of the website is stylish and functional without being too flashy, which I have always found to be an important balance in web design.
