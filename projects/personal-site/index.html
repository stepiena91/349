<h1>Alex Stepien's Personal Website</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Alex Stepien and you've somehow found your way to my website. I created this site for the class TC349 at Michigan State University. This page is a work in progress and was made for the purpose of learning about various elements of web design. If it looks like garbage now, don't worry! It'll get better I assume.</p>
<p>Here are the topics on this site and a brief explanation:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Home - where you are right now; an introduction to the website</li>
	<li>Education - a glimpse at my past and current school experience</li>
	<li>Hobbies - this is where you can find out what I do in my free time</li>
	<li>History - here you can read a short biography about myself</li>
</ul>

<p>That's about all I've got for this page, feel free to click the links at the bottom of the page and discover the wonder and mystery behind the elusive Alex Stepien.</p>
