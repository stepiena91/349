<h1>Personal History</h1>
<h2>The Alex Stepien Autobiography: The Abridged Version</h2>
<p>I grew up in the Metro Detroit area of southeast Michigan. As I grew up I found a strong interest in reading books and writing, which I still have today. After a few years of playing various classical instruments in the school band, I decided that I wanted to learn to play the bass guitar. During my sophomore year of high school, my brother's friends were in need of a bass player and apparently they didn't mind that I was only 15 years old and not very good. After a few months of practice, we actually began sounding pretty good together and played a few shows, most notably at Small's bar in Hamtramck. Since I started attending Michigan State University, I have pretty much made the East Lansing area my home. I'm currently pursuing my degree, working as a driver at Jimmy John's, and enjoying life to the fullest (usually within reason).</p>
