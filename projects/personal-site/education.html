<h1>Education</h1>
<h2>Pre-College</h2>
<p>I began my arduous task of education at the elementary school Trinity Lutheran in Clinton Township, MI. It was a private parochial school that aimed to prepare their students for high school. Whether or not that happened is open for debate. After that, I attended Lutheran High School North in Macomb, Michigan. The faculty liked to refer to the school as "college preparatory", but once again, that fact is up for debate. It was here I was exposed to my first few intellectually challenging classes, so I suppose I could say it did slightly prepare my for higher education.</p>
<h2>College</h2>
<p>I first started attending Michigan State University in the fall of 2009. Initially I was unsure about what degree to pursue, but I felt that it would probably be something to do with business. After a few semesters of figuring out that business wasn't for me, I found my current major: Media and Communication Technology. My specialization for my major is Information Technology with a business cognate.</p>
