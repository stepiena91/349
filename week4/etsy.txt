At first glance, etsy.com doesn't make much of an impression on the visitor. The colors and fonts used are plain, with the exception of the etsy logo. Since this site's purpose is to sell items, I would think that the colors would be more eye-catching. Other than that, I think the layout is logical and easy to use.

One problem I have with the site is that the navigation at the top and bottom of the page are not uniform throughout the website. I've always been told that the navigation on a website should always be the same for every page so that the user feels they're in the same "place". Certain pages include facebook and twitter links, while others only have a title.
