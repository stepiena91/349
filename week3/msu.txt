Overall, I think that Michigan State University's homepage does what it needs to do and looks good doing it. The first thing most people will notice when they go to the site is the animated images that advertise various events and news happening at MSU. It is both eye-catching and useful, and also isn't too distracting from the rest of the content on the page. Beneath that there are a few text links to more news and events, along with a twitter feed.

The site navigation at the top of the page is easy-to-use and fits the general look of the website. There is also a search bar at the top right of the page that helps users find what they're looking for if the navigation bar doesn't help. The bottom of the page includes contact information, a "support MSU" button, and links to various social networks that MSU is a part of. The site is well organized and offers a few helpful services to users.
